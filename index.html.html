<p>At Supercars.net we’re obsessed with companies like Lamborghini. We have so much content about this amazing company and the cars they create that we decided to get it organized. The result is this page, it is our Lamborghini hub. We have a page with all the latest and greatest Lamborghini news and reviews, as well as Lamborghini galleries and Lamborghini videos sections for those who want to sit and relax for a while with all the amazing images and crazy action from the world of Lamborghini.<br><br>
	Ferruccio Lamborghini took old military machines and re-purposed them as agriculture supplies such as tractors. He became very wealthy. Like anyone who comes into wealth, he bought several luxury cars, including a Ferrari. When he provided Enzo Ferrari feedback on some of the shortfalls in his cars, Ferrari told him to buzz off (paraphrasing). The rivalry had begun and Lamborghini decided to turn his hobby into a passion. Lamborghini the car company was born.<br><br>
	If you’re a die-hard fan of Team Bull for supercar glory, what you’re going to read next is just solidification of why this brand is a great in-your-face alternative to the snooty, posh supercar competitors. If you’ve just heard of Lamborghini, well what you’re about to read is the history of how one man’s pursuit of greatness and improvement developed a stable of the best supercars mankind has ever seen. Lamborghini’s Greatest Hits include, but not limited to the 400GT, Miura, Countach, Diablo, Murciélago and Aventador.<br><br>
et us at Supercars.net walk you through a path filled with a brash, enigmatic man that wanted to show the world, and one person in particular, that his skills should not be belittled, and that the design philosophy is to not care about car racing, or capturing the podium but to produce cars that would capture people’s imaginations and break the mould of what a car should be. Before we get into the whirlwind empire that is Lamborghini.<br><br>
The Lamborghini logo is in the shape of a shield that is filled with a black background and outlined with gold. Across the top of the shield is the word Lamborghini in capital letters above an image of a golden bull. Ferruccio Lamborghini believed that the bull was the perfect image to use on his company’s logo as it was a reflection of himself (he war born in Tauras and was big fan of bullfighting).</p>

<p>Forged from a racing heritage, Enzo Ferrari wasn’t initially interested in building road cars. When he created Scuderia Ferrari in 1929, he just wanted to buy existing cars and build them into race cars. He wanted to build a stable of fast cars, which is the literal translation of his company: “Ferrari’s Stable” or “Team Ferrari”.<br><br>

His start in life as a racing driver for Alfa Romeo drove his passion for building fast, record-breaking cars that will withstand the test of time. After branching out of Alfa Romeo to build his own legacy, his drive and hustle to beat his former boss laid the foundation to the Ferrari that we all know and cherish today.<br><br>

His guidance built the definition of what we now know as ‘supercars’ and has given the world great examples of supercar. His legacy lives on through his cars, but let us not forget his beginnings.<br><br>

Ferrari’s philosophy “building the greatest cars in the world.” So it is fitting when you think of awesome sports cars, one brand immediately comes to mind and that is Ferrari. Everything about Ferrari cars is great, unique and recognizable. Performance is amazing and they are constantly dragging the automotive industry into the future.<br><br>

For many decades Ferrari has been one of the top motor car brands. The short list of greatest Ferrari road cars isn’t a short list at all. Ferrari has an uncanny ability to produce some of the best sports and road cars in history. So here are the top 10 Ferraris of the past 6 decades, noting that we include the current Ferrari 458 Italia and LaFerrari in the list too.<br><br>

The 250 GTO may be considered the first in the line of Ferrari supercars and it was a gem. They haven’t looked back. The Dino was the first mid-engined Ferrari and while down on power, it looked gorgeous and this layout would go on to be used in most Ferraris.  The 288 GTO and 599 GTO were crazy models based on existing models. The F40 is still considered by most the be the best supercar ever, the Enzo was the defining moment celebrating Ferrari’s awesome F1 run in the late 1990s.</p>

<div class="hhhhh"><h1>Porsche</h1></div><br>
<div class="por">

<p>The Porsche name has become synonymous with sports cars and race cars because that is what company founders Ferdinand Porsche and his son Ferdinand (“Ferry”) set out to build when they first set up shop with 200 workers in 1948.<br><br>

While it is currently a thriving brand under the Volkswagen Automotive Group, standing alongside Lamborghini, Audi, and Bugatti this car company has a colorful history and iconic cars list that goes way deeper than most Cayenne, Macan and Panamera buyers will ever know.<br><br>

Ferdinand Porsche’s first iconic vehicle was not under his own marque, but what we all know as “Volkswagen” or “The People’s Car”. The Volkswagen Beetle was his creation and was the stepping stone to a racing history with the 911 as a cornerstone. World War II changed things and the man was ousted out of the Volkswagen company, forcing him and his son to form their own car company, Porsche.<br><br>

There first hit was the 356. Though sporting just 40 horsepower from a rear-mounted, slightly souped-up Beetle engine, the first Porsche quickly made its mark with agile handling, as well as attributes almost unknown among sportscars of the day — comfort and reliability. Porsche introduced its own engines in the mid-1950s, along with more powerful versions of the 356. After the 356 came a true legend among modern automobiles, the Porsche 911. Ahead of its time when introduced in 1964, the rear-engine 911 has continued to evolve since then and is considered by most the ultimate sports car.<br><br>

Porsche introduced a series of front-engine models in the 1970s, starting with the four-cylinder 924 (1976) and the unrelated 928 powered by the company’s first V-8 engine (1978). From the 924 sprang the more powerful and sophisticated 944 and 944 Turbo, and finally the 968 in the early ‘90s. Porsche retired both the 968 and 928 in 1995 to focus on development of the rear-engine 911 and mid-engine Boxster.<br><br>

Porsche is also synonymous with racing, and Porsche cars began competing almost immediately. To date, Porsche cars have won an estimated 24,000 auto races around the world, including more than 50 class wins at Le Mans. You can see why the way people talk about Porsche with reverence. No other car company has the same credentials. No other car company has so many hits. Porsche has built some of the most amazing cars ever.</p>
