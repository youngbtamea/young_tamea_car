	Ferruccio Lamborghini took old military machines and re-purposed them as agriculture supplies such as tractors. He became very wealthy. Like anyone who comes into wealth, he bought several luxury cars, including a Ferrari. When he provided Enzo Ferrari feedback on some of the shortfalls in his cars, Ferrari told him to buzz off (paraphrasing). The rivalry had begun and Lamborghini decided to turn his hobby into a passion. Lamborghini the car company was born.<br><br>

et us at Supercars.net walk you through a path filled with a brash, enigmatic man that wanted to show the world, and one person in particular, that his skills should not be belittled, and that the design philosophy is to not care about car racing, or capturing the podium but to produce cars that would capture people’s imaginations and break the mould of what a car should be. Before we get into the whirlwind empire that is Lamborghini.<br><br>
The Lamborghini logo is in the shape of a shield that is filled with a black background and outlined with gold. Across the top of the shield is the word Lamborghini in capital letters above an image of a golden bull. Ferruccio Lamborghini believed that the bull was the perfect image to use on his company’s logo as it was a reflection of himself (he war born in Tauras and was big fan of bullfighting).</p>
